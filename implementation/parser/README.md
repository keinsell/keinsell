# Parser

A parser is a software component that analyzes text according to a grammar to determine its structure. Parsers are commonly used in:

- Programming language compilers and interpreters
- Data format processors (JSON, XML, etc.)
- Natural language processing
- Document processing

This repository contains a parser implementation that transforms structured input into a usable format for further processing.
