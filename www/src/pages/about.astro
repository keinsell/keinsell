				<h1>About This Site</h1>
				<p>Personal documentation of life and learnings.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="content">
				<p>This is a personal website that serves as tribute to the biggest mistake I've made in life: not documenting things. Combined with the lack of formal university education, this led me to a horrible place without exit. This site isn't meant to be a colorful story of successes, but an honest account of both the ups and downs on the road - because when someone says they didn't have problems, they're most likely lying.</p>

				<h3>Why This Exists</h3>
				
				<p>Every developer has struggled. Every person has failed. This site documents those failures alongside the learnings, the mistakes alongside the breakthroughs. It's a record of a self-taught developer's journey through an industry that often demands credentials I don't have and experience I had to build from scratch.</p>

				<h3>What You'll Find</h3>
				
				<p><strong><a href="/">Home</a></strong> - Recent thoughts and posts. The ongoing narrative of someone trying to build meaningful things despite the odds.</p>
				
				<p><strong><a href="/blog">Blog</a></strong> - Technical writings that document both successes and spectacular failures. Honest takes on software development, tools that didn't work, projects that crashed and burned, and the rare moments when things actually came together.</p>
				
				<p><strong><a href="/story">Story</a></strong> - The longer narrative of how someone without formal training ended up in tech, made costly mistakes, and kept going anyway.</p>

				<h3>The Reality</h3>
				
				<p>This site chronicles:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Projects that failed before they started</li>
					<li>Code that looked smart but broke everything</li>
					<li>Technical debt that haunted me for years</li>
					<li>Imposter syndrome in a field full of CS graduates</li>
					<li>The occasional breakthrough that made it all worth it</li>
					<li>Honest takes on technologies that everyone pretends to love</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Why Document This</h3>
				
				<p>Not documenting my journey was my biggest mistake. Every problem I solved in isolation, I later saw others struggle with. Every dead end I hit, someone else was also hitting. By not sharing the failures, the debugging sessions that went nowhere, the architectures that seemed brilliant but collapsed - I robbed both myself and others of valuable lessons.</p>

				<p>This site is my attempt to correct that mistake. To show that everyone struggles, everyone fails, and that's not just okay - it's necessary. The goal isn't inspiration or motivation. It's honesty about what building software actually looks like when you strip away the LinkedIn posts and conference talks.</p>
