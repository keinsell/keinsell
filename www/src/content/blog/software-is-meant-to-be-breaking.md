I agree to disagree. That's what I have heard in every company or team I happened to be (quite not good to say about myself, but I have no power who decides to hire me and who doesn't).

I am convinced by my own mind and process that it's not necessary to break software during development process, only reason why I choose to break it is when it's faster and there are no consequences from doing so.

Line comes in intention over somebody's actions, and we all are egoists - so when one's intention is to take payroll and leave no matter what there will be no quality considered and all shortcuts will be taken, when there would be at least little of responsibility for one's action or one would feel responsible then would be thinking twice before taking shortcuts.

It doesn't meant to be this way, and there's whole-ass set of knowledge which comes down purely to avoiding one's own mistakes, but when one is paid no matter of what and payment is the only motivation - why should one care?

You can setup linter for a codebase, but this do not help at all - how linter can help in cases where >80% PRs that I have been reviewing had signs of not being even turn on locally (ex. build error w/o type-checking), we can talk about improvement of tools that we had over decade but ignorance of developer that I hope you will never met is just hopeless.

It's not even retarded, it's just fucking hopeless... Hopeless and disgusting.
