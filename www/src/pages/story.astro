                <h4>Early Beginnings and Cryptocurrency</h4>

                <p>
                    I began my journey into technology around 2010 when I
                    received my first computer. My early days were spent
                    building Minecraft servers on Bukkit, which introduced me to
                    Java programming. Alongside coding, I spent countless hours
                    in games like World of Warcraft and Warframe, where I honed
                    my skills in virtual economies through auction house
                    trading.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By 2015-2016, I had become deeply involved in the
                    cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin, still a mysterious concept to
                    many, fascinated me. I immersed myself in understanding its
                    underlying value, mechanisms, and the conflicting narratives
                    surrounding it. This period was formative, as I became
                    interested in trading and the concept of value, not as
                    gambling, but as a study of patterns, market psychology, and
                    the fluctuation of value through systems.
                </p>

                <h4>Freelancing and Early Career Struggles</h4>

                <p>
                    Between 2018-2020, while attending a technical high school,
                    I started freelancing and became the maintainer of the
                    school network. This hands-on experience was invaluable, but
                    my journey was not without challenges. Between 2019 and
                    2021, I faced a brutal reality check, failing over 50 job
                    interviews. This period was marked by frustration and
                    self-doubt, but it also taught me valuable lessons about the
                    industry and myself.
                </p>

                <h4>Breakthrough and Professional Evolution</h4>

                <p>
                    In 2022, I finally landed my first full-time job as a junior
                    back-end developer. This year also marked the birth of my
                    online persona, "keinsell," during a significant moment in
                    my cryptocurrency trading journey. Mid-bullrun, when
                    everyone was caught in Bitcoin euphoria, I made a public
                    call to short Bitcoin. My analysis proved correct,
                    validating years of studying market psychology and learning
                    to trust my analysis over the noise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My professional journey continued as I rose to Lead Software
                    Engineer at stepapp.pl in late 2024. However, this role came
                    with significant challenges that reshaped my approach to the
                    industry. I learned not to blindly trust titles and
                    experienced firsthand the consequences of cargo cult
                    engineering. By November 2024, I reached a breaking point
                    and stepped away from my position, unable to continue in an
                    environment where I was expected to take responsibility for
                    others' mistakes without any willingness to improve.
                </p>

                <h4>Technical Journey and Personal Direction</h4>

                <p>
                    During this period of reset, I immersed myself in Rust and
                    built an understanding of its memory management model. I
                    fell in love with compiler errors that actually help,
                    effortless tooling, and community-driven development. I also
                    explored OCaml, finding it offered rapid prototyping while
                    maintaining correctness through its type system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of my projects, neuronek, a Rust-based terminal
                    application to track caffeine intake using neuroscience and
                    pharmacokinetics, exemplifies my approach to building tools
                    that are valuable to me personally, fitting seamlessly into
                    my workflow.
                </p>

                <h4>Industry Perspective and the Path Forward</h4>

                <p>
                    My journey spans two worlds: the financial realm, where
                    everything must be profitable and measurable, and the
                    creator's realm, where open-source contributions, late-night
                    coding sessions, and niche tools aren't financially "worth
                    it" by conventional metrics, yet people create them anyway.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The industry's approach often confuses me—the fundamental
                    lack of understanding around types and metaprogramming, the
                    fixation on moving data between databases and interfaces
                    while struggling even with that. Almost every problem in
                    e-commerce was solved years ago, yet people insist on
                    implementing complex architectures and creating unnecessary
                    microservices with tiny teams. This disconnect between
                    what's necessary and what's practiced characterizes modern
                    tech—a wasteland of reinvented wheels and needless
                    complexity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am now seeking a position where I can contribute freely
                    and autonomously, where quality is measured by stability and
                    maintainability, not just delivery speed. I'd rather take a
                    Rust/OCaml internship than a Senior+ position in TypeScript,
                    which, despite its popularity, lacks robust tooling and a
                    type system I can trust.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an architect on the desert, I survey possibilities while
                    building on principles I believe in. My understanding of
                    value guides me through this landscape, helping me identify
                    what's worth pursuing and what's just noise. Welcome to my
                    corner of the internet, where profit meets purpose. Let's
                    build something that lasts—something that embodies values
                    that have become all too scarce.
                </p>
