					<p><em>This story will incrementally improve and will be split into multiple posts because I will not let myself live without doing that - let be this place toxic as it can be.</em></p>

					<h4>Early Beginnings and Cryptocurrency</h4>

					<p>I began my journey into technology around 2010 when I received my first computer. My early days were spent building Minecraft servers on Bukkit, which introduced me to Java programming. Alongside coding, I spent countless hours in games like World of Warcraft and Warframe, where I honed my skills in virtual economies through auction house trading.</p>

					<p>By 2015-2016, I had become deeply involved in the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin, still a mysterious concept to many, fascinated me. I immersed myself in understanding its underlying value, mechanisms, and the conflicting narratives surrounding it. This period was formative, as I became interested in trading and the concept of value, not as gambling, but as a study of patterns, market psychology, and the fluctuation of value through systems.</p>

					<h4>Freelancing and Early Career Struggles</h4>

					<p>Between 2018-2020, while attending a technical high school, I started freelancing and became the maintainer of the school network. This hands-on experience was invaluable, but my journey was not without challenges. Between 2019 and 2021, I faced a brutal reality check, failing over 50 job interviews. This period was marked by frustration and self-doubt, but it also taught me valuable lessons about the industry and myself.</p>

					<h4>Breakthrough and Professional Evolution</h4>

					<p>In 2022, I finally landed my first full-time job as a junior back-end developer. This year also marked the birth of my online persona, "keinsell," during a significant moment in my cryptocurrency trading journey. Mid-bullrun, when everyone was caught in Bitcoin euphoria, I made a public call to short Bitcoin. My analysis proved correct, validating years of studying market psychology and learning to trust my analysis over the noise.</p>

					<p>My professional journey continued as I rose to Lead Software Engineer at stepapp.pl in late 2024. However, this role came with significant challenges that reshaped my approach to the industry. I learned not to blindly trust titles and experienced firsthand the consequences of cargo cult engineering. By November 2024, I reached a breaking point and stepped away from my position, unable to continue in an environment where I was expected to take responsibility for others' mistakes without any willingness to improve.</p>

					<h4>Technical Journey and Personal Direction</h4>

					<p>During this period of reset, I immersed myself in Rust and built an understanding of its memory management model. I fell in love with compiler errors that actually help, effortless tooling, and community-driven development. I also explored OCaml, finding it offered rapid prototyping while maintaining correctness through its type system.</p>

					<p>One of my projects, neuronek, a Rust-based terminal application to track caffeine intake using neuroscience and pharmacokinetics, exemplifies my approach to building tools that are valuable to me personally, fitting seamlessly into my workflow.</p>

					<h4>Industry Perspective and the Path Forward</h4>

					<p>My journey spans two worlds: the financial realm, where everything must be profitable and measurable, and the creator's realm, where open-source contributions, late-night coding sessions, and niche tools aren't financially "worth it" by conventional metrics, yet people create them anyway.</p>

					<p>The industry's approach often confuses me—the fundamental lack of understanding around types and metaprogramming, the fixation on moving data between databases and interfaces while struggling even with that. Almost every problem in e-commerce was solved years ago, yet people insist on implementing complex architectures and creating unnecessary microservices with tiny teams. This disconnect between what's necessary and what's practiced characterizes modern tech—a wasteland of reinvented wheels and needless complexity.</p>

					<p>I am now seeking a position where I can contribute freely and autonomously, where quality isn't measured solely by speed but by stability and maintainability. I'd rather take a Rust/OCaml internship than a Senior+ position in TypeScript, which, despite its popularity, lacks robust tooling and a type system I can trust.</p>

					<p>As an architect on the desert, I survey possibilities while building on principles I believe in. My understanding of value guides me through this landscape, helping me identify what's worth pursuing and what's just noise. Welcome to my corner of the internet, where profit meets purpose. Let's build something that lasts—something that embodies values that have become all too scarce.</p>
